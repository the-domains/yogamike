            <title><![CDATA[It has been said that true meditation is about being present, experiencing all that is, rather than escaping from it. I find it necessary to periodically take little mini vacations from the daily grind, and in doing so, refresh my sense of natural divinity, to carry it with me in the chaos of city life. I often go outside and meditate, but I have learned to find little glimpses of it in the mundane as well - sun shines in the window and catches my eye.. Ahhh, so nice! A breeze blows by and I witness the spiral dance of leaves blowing.. Beautiful! I lock eyes with a stranger and we both smile.. Priceless. Yoga practice awakens within me the capacity to recognize and revel in these momentary glimpses beyond the veil. We are only fooling ourselves with the myriad of distractions we surround ourselves with and compose our lives from. May we all continue to be blessed with the natural splendor of life, and continue to uphold it as sacred and essential. Excuse me while I go hug a tree... Haha!]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[My attachment to doing vinyasas for exercise has relaxed considerably, and I started allowing myself more time, freedom, and creativity in my practice. I no longer feel the urgency to do more than I can already comfortably do. The movements have been methodical, yet minimal, and I keep finding myself inspired to simply stay still and go deeply into the sensation of an asana and all that accompanies it. I think I'm starting to understand and integrate Sutra 2.47 into my practice. And as I spend more time in a perfect state of bliss while doing asanas, the number of asanas and the complexity of them both diminish - like a narrowing down to the essentials of vinyasa practice.. and allowing the internal practices, antaranga sadhana, to take prevalence over my physical fitness ideals. I imagine it's a humbling experience for many yogis - starting to feel like they want to spend their workout time slot meditating, belly rolls and all. For me it's a time when I really start to question; where does this desire for a ripped, lean body come from? Why does it even matter what I think I look like to other people? And the ever prevalent "What in the wide world of modern convenience am I supposed to eat if I want to stay trim and pooping regularly?" Nevertheless, burrowing deeper into the jumble of thought patterns is turning out to be a lifelong trip, and the mindfulness of it all has led me to continuously explore and evolve my practice. Ironically I think I love the asanas even more now than I did when I first realized I could float or do legs behind the head or whatever. The asanas themselves have become cherished teachers, if you ask me, that is really cool!]]></title>
