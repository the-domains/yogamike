            <title><![CDATA[My attachment to doing vinyasas for exercise has relaxed considerably, and I started allowing myself more time, freedom, and creativity in my practice. I no longer feel the urgency to do more than I can already comfortably do. The movements have been methodical, yet minimal, and I keep finding myself inspired to simply stay still and go deeply into the sensation of an asana and all that accompanies it. I think I'm starting to understand and integrate Sutra 2.47 into my practice. And as I spend more time in a perfect state of bliss while doing asanas, the number of asanas and the complexity of them both diminish - like a narrowing down to the essentials of vinyasa practice.. and allowing the internal practices, antaranga sadhana, to take prevalence over my physical fitness ideals. I imagine it's a humbling experience for many yogis - starting to feel like they want to spend their workout time slot meditating, belly rolls and all. For me it's a time when I really start to question; where does this desire for a ripped, lean body come from? Why does it even matter what I think I look like to other people? And the ever prevalent "What in the wide world of modern convenience am I supposed to eat if I want to stay trim and pooping regularly?" Nevertheless, burrowing deeper into the jumble of thought patterns is turning out to be a lifelong trip, and the mindfulness of it all has led me to continuously explore and evolve my practice. Ironically I think I love the asanas even more now than I did when I first realized I could float or do legs behind the head or whatever. The asanas themselves have become cherished teachers, if you ask me, that is really cool!]]></title>
