            <title><![CDATA[Many yogis seem to equate "depth" of a posture, or "advanced" variations with skill. They think that by doing the full bind, or the lotus variation.. that they will be doing it better than simply the basic alignment of the posture. I had a conversation about this with a student last night.. Over the past few years he has seen me exploring numerous "advanced" vinyasas, so it was surprising for him to hear me explain how my practice has evolved to mostly exclude them. I was explaining that when teachers like myself offer various progressive stages in a mixed levels class i.e. "If you feel comfortable here, you can go a little deeper by.." that we are not implying that going further would be appropriate or beneficial for everyone. I advised him that even if he thinks he can take it to the furthest limit, to allow the posture to evolve naturally through the breath.. Let the ability to breathe, or in some cases lack thereof, help to determine whether to continue further, stay put, or even back up. I think he was a little amused when I told him that even though I can go to another teacher's class and do some very deeply contorted variations of postures, I will intentionally hold back - because I've done it before and I know that no amount of lotus, or leg behind the head, or floating, etc. is going to get me any closer to "enlightenment".. And I also know to weigh the pros and cons.. Sure I can stand up with my leg behind my head, but how is my sacrum going to feel for the next few days? Sure I can do all the headstand variations, but am I willing to live with neck pain? - if I make one slightly wrong move, I may have to do so!.. The point is that advanced asana practice is not about how far you can stretch. Yoga Sutras 2.46-2.48 teach us the classical way to achieve and perfect asana, and the result of doing it correctly. This is unfortunately skimmed over or omitted from much of the exercise themed modern vinyasa flow classes. However I encourage all yogis to at least familiarize themselves with these sutras, even if they don't care to practice in that way during class.. Asana is very beautiful and serene, internally, even if it looks basic from outside.]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[My attachment to doing vinyasas for exercise has relaxed considerably, and I started allowing myself more time, freedom, and creativity in my practice. I no longer feel the urgency to do more than I can already comfortably do. The movements have been methodical, yet minimal, and I keep finding myself inspired to simply stay still and go deeply into the sensation of an asana and all that accompanies it. I think I'm starting to understand and integrate Sutra 2.47 into my practice. And as I spend more time in a perfect state of bliss while doing asanas, the number of asanas and the complexity of them both diminish - like a narrowing down to the essentials of vinyasa practice.. and allowing the internal practices, antaranga sadhana, to take prevalence over my physical fitness ideals. I imagine it's a humbling experience for many yogis - starting to feel like they want to spend their workout time slot meditating, belly rolls and all. For me it's a time when I really start to question; where does this desire for a ripped, lean body come from? Why does it even matter what I think I look like to other people? And the ever prevalent "What in the wide world of modern convenience am I supposed to eat if I want to stay trim and pooping regularly?" Nevertheless, burrowing deeper into the jumble of thought patterns is turning out to be a lifelong trip, and the mindfulness of it all has led me to continuously explore and evolve my practice. Ironically I think I love the asanas even more now than I did when I first realized I could float or do legs behind the head or whatever. The asanas themselves have become cherished teachers, if you ask me, that is really cool!]]></title>
