description: "\"Yoga defines the problem of our human existence very concretely. We suffer because we confuse the mind for the Spirit, the ego for the Self. Freedom can only be obtained by resolving this mix-up, first by understanding the nature of the mind, and then by achieving the immediate experience of Spirit, or True Self. Patanjali explains that freedom can't be attained through study or learning. It is ours only when we enter timelessness and taste infinity. To do so requires breaking free of the trappings of he material world, and our minds.\" - Dr. Alberto Villoldo"
