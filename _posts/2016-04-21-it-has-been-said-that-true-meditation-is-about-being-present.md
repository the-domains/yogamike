title: 'It has been said that true meditation is about being present, experiencing all that is, rather than escaping from it. I find it necessary to periodically take little mini vacations from the daily grind, and in doing so, refresh my sense of natural divinity, to carry it with me in the chaos of city life. I often go outside and meditate, but I have learned to find little glimpses of it in the mundane as well - sun shines in the window and catches my eye.. Ahhh, so nice! A breeze blows by and I witness the spiral dance of leaves blowing.. Beautiful! I lock eyes with a stranger and we both smile.. Priceless. Yoga practice awakens within me the capacity to recognize and revel in these momentary glimpses beyond the veil. We are only fooling ourselves with the myriad of distractions we surround ourselves with and compose our lives from. May we all continue to be blessed with the natural splendor of life, and continue to uphold it as sacred and essential. Excuse me while I go hug a tree... Haha!'
