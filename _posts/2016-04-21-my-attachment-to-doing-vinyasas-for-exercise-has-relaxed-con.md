description: 'My attachment to doing vinyasas for exercise has relaxed considerably, and I have allowed myself more time, freedom, and creativity. I no longer feel the urgency to do more than I can already comfortably do.

My attachment to doing vinyasas for exercise has relaxed considerably, and I have allowed myself more time, freedom, and creativity. I no longer feel the urgency to do more than I can already comfortably do. The movements have been methodical, yet minimal, and I keep finding myself inspired to simply stay still and go deeply into the sensation of an asana and all that accompanies it.
