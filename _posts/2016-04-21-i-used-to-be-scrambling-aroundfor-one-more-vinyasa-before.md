title: 'I used to be scrambling around..for one more vinyasa before leaving for work.. My practice has shifted tremendously over the years, to where I now find myself pushing the last few moments of pranayama before I absolutely have to leave to get somewhere on time. This morning I found myself questioning "would I even practice vinyasas for exercise anymore if my body just naturally stayed fit and supple? Or would I derive my entire practice from pranayama and meditation?'
